# Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)

A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) in Kubernetes is used to request storage resources from an underlying storage system, whether that is a local storage system, cloud provider storage, or network storage system.

The PVC is typically associated with a Persistent Volume (PV), which represents the actual storage resource.
